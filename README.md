# Cleaned Dataset [Task-1] from Elevate-Labs
 
This repository contains a cleaned dataset, prepared entirely using **Microsoft Excel** and **keyboard shortcuts**. The dataset was manually cleaned to improve consistency, accuracy, and usability for analysis or further processing.

📄 File Description

- `Cleaned_Dataset.xlsx` – The cleaned version of the original dataset.

🧹 Cleaning Steps

All data cleaning tasks were completed using Excel only, without any scripts or external tools. Key steps included:

- Removing duplicate rows
- Standardizing text formatting (e.g. consistent casing, trimming spaces)
- Correcting common input errors
- Handling missing values (filling or removing where needed)
- Organizing columns and rows for better readability
- Applying filters and basic conditional formatting to review data quality

⌨️ Tools & Techniques

- **Microsoft Excel**
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** such as:
  - `Ctrl + Shift + L` – Toggle filters
  - `Ctrl + Arrow Keys` – Navigate large datasets
  - `Alt + H, O` - formatting
  - `Alt + E, S, V` – Paste special
  - And many more for quick editing and formatting

The resulting Excel file is clean, consistent, and ready for use in analytics, reporting, or integration into other workflows.
